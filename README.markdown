This is the revised and updated version of MapRuler originally created here.

This will put a dotted line on the world map showing you exactly where your character is pointed. It can be handy when flying from one place to another. Simply put the line on where you want to go and turn on autorun.

The dotted line is only visible in outdoor zones, cities, and continent level maps.
